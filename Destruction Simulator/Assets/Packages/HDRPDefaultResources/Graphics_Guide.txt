Custom pass -> https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@11.0/manual/Custom-Pass.html
Custom buffer format -> *
Realtime raytracing -> off
Lod Bias -> Set the level-of-detail (LOD) bias.LOD levels are chosen based on the onscreen size of an object. When the size is between two LOD levels, the choice can be biased toward the less detailed or more detailed of the two Models available. This is set as a fraction from 0 to +infinity. When it is set between 0 and 1 it favors less detail. A setting of more than 1 favors greater detail. For example, setting LOD Bias to 2 and having it change at 50% distance, LOD actually only changes on 25%.
Maximum LOD -> Set the highest LOD that the game uses. See Maximum LOD level for more information.

Volumetrics -> https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@11.0/manual/Override-Visual-Environment.html

Distortion -> like fire heating air , it will move space time ( also used for lens )
